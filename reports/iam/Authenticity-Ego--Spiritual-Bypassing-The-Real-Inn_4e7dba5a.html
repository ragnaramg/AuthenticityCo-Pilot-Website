      "detail": "Before responding with agreement phrases like \"Yeah, man,\" count to three. This creates space for your guest to continue or for you to formulate a more substantive response. In this episode, 40% of your responses were single-word agreements - reducing this by half would create more dynamic exchanges."

      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [

        "The exposure therapy story about wearing trackies to work revealed your growth mindset and willingness to challenge social conditioning. This practical spirituality approach makes complex concepts accessible to listeners.",
