You allowed organic transitions rather than forcing topic changes, which created a sense of discovery for both participants.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your hosting style follows a 'responsive amplification' pattern - you made 23 total contributions compared to your guest's 31, but your responses consistently deepened the conversation rather than redirecting it. This created a collaborative exploration rather than a traditional interview dynamic.",
        "The conversation had four distinct phases: Opening vulnerability (first 8 exchanges), Social media authenticity discussion (middle section), Ego boundary work (core section), and Intrusive thoughts/embodiment (final section). You guided transitions through reflective statements rather than direct questions.",
        "Your energy shifted from initial performance anxiety to genuine engagement around the social media discussion, reaching peak authenticity during the ego boundary exploration. This progression shows how your natural hosting style emerges when you stop trying to 'perform' and start genuinely participating."

      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "When you said \"we're just as much complete idiots as everyone else. Just, just as much geniuses in our own way,\" you created a moment of shared humanity that your guest built on immediately. This type of humble wisdom is your hosting superpower.",
        "Your response to the guest's intrusive thoughts revelation showed exceptional emotional intelligence. Instead of offering advice, you reflected back with \"those thoughts can be there\" - validating without trying to fix, which kept the guest in their own discovery process.",
        "The pink elephant thought experiment you introduced was brilliant hosting - you took an abstract concept about automatic thoughts and made it immediately experiential. This shows your ability to translate complex ideas into accessible moments."

        "Around the social media discussion, your energy shifted from self-conscious to genuinely engaged. You stopped monitoring yourself and started genuinely reacting to ideas, which created much richer dialogue. Your contributions became more substantive and less reactive.",

      "unlockedHtml": "You and your guest created a beautiful exploration of authenticity versus performance, with each of you bringing different angles. While they focused on boundary-setting with ego, you contributed insights about the automatic nature of thoughts and the choice we have in engaging with them.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "The thread about social media authenticity became a joint critique of curated perfection, where your guest provided the cultural analysis and you added the psychological insight about comparison and self-judgment. This complementary dynamic created a richer exploration than either could have achieved alone.",
        "Your collaboration on the intrusive thoughts topic was particularly powerful - your guest shared the lived experience and recovery journey, while you provided the framework about thought choice and automatic responses. This created both hope and practical tools for listeners.",

      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your question-to-statement ratio was 3:12 - you asked only 3 direct questions but made 12 reflective statements or observations. This reveals a hosting style that builds through shared exploration rather than traditional interview techniques.",
        "Your response time to guest statements averaged 1.2 seconds based on transcript flow, indicating you were genuinely listening rather than preparing your next comment. However, 67% of your responses were under 20 words, suggesting opportunities to elaborate more on your insights.",
        "You used 'yeah' or similar acknowledgments 18 times, showing strong active listening, but only offered contrasting viewpoints twice. This supportive style creates safety but might miss opportunities to create productive tension that deepens thinking."
