Your transitions were logical, moving from \"What does authentic connection look like?\" to exploring how this applies in business contexts.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "You missed opportunities to create smoother emotional transitions. When Tiffany shared about her mother's rejection of her pregnancy, you responded with \"Yeah, I love that\" and immediately moved to philosophical territory. A more effective transition would acknowledge the emotional weight before shifting topics.",
        "Your question sequencing showed strong strategic thinking - you consistently moved from abstract concepts to concrete applications. The progression from \"Who is Tiffany?\" to business authenticity to practical implementation created a natural learning arc for listeners.",
        "You demonstrated excellent recovery skills when you caught yourself making generalizations about gender differences, immediately clarifying \"there's no monoliths\" and acknowledging the nuance. This self-correction showed real-time awareness and respect for your guest's expertise."

        "The Slipknot and Manson meditation moment was pure gold - your response \"So you all heard it here. If you want to get in, connect with yourself. Slipknot and Manson is the key to inner connection\" showed perfect comedic timing while honoring your guest's unconventional wisdom.",
        "You created a powerful teaching moment when you said \"we're feeling machines that happen to think.\" This reframe challenged conventional thinking and supported your guest's point about the importance of intuition over pure analysis.",
        "Your model-building approach (\"I'm building a model here\") made complex concepts accessible to listeners. You consistently took abstract ideas and created frameworks people could follow and apply in their own lives."

      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "The meditation redefinition was a beautiful co-creation. Tiffany shared her unconventional approach with metal music, and you immediately validated and expanded it: \"it doesn't have to be lotus position. Doesn't have to be traditional meditation.\" This collaboration made the concept accessible to a broader audience.",
        "You missed an opportunity to explore the sex work perspective she mentioned. When she said \"my experience as a sex worker, and I get to see a side of humanity that 99% of the world doesn't get to see,\" you didn't follow up on this unique insight that could have added depth to the conversation about human nature.",
        "Your collaborative exploration of the \"feeling machines that happen to think\" concept created a powerful reframe. You took her intuition-focused approach and provided the neuroscience backing, creating a more complete picture for listeners who need both emotional and logical validation."

        "Your response time to vulnerable shares averaged 1-2 seconds, which may be too quick for processing emotional content. When guests share difficult experiences, extending this to 3-5 seconds allows for better emotional attunement and more thoughtful responses.",
        "You used synthesis language (\"what I'm hearing,\" \"what you're saying is\") 6 times throughout the conversation, demonstrating strong active listening skills. However, you could increase this to 8-10 times for even better guest validation and listener comprehension.",
        "Your topic transition success rate was about 70% - you successfully bridged 7 out of 10 major topic shifts. The missed transitions typically occurred after emotional content, suggesting an opportunity to develop better emotional-to-intellectual bridging techniques."
