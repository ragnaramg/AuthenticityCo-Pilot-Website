    "quoteHtml": "\"Dr. Z, this conversation is incredibly fresh, but it's incredibly intimidating because we don't really experience adults talking about us in such a positive light with such rigor and intensity.\" - Your raw honesty about the rarity of positive generational dialogue revealed the deeper impact of the conversation."

Your pacing allowed for deep exploration - the guest's longest response was 847 words about technology, showing you gave space for complex ideas.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your conversation had four distinct phases: Stereotype Deconstruction (first 6 exchanges), Solution Exploration (middle 8 exchanges), Technology Deep-dive (3 exchanges), and Personal Revelation (final 4 exchanges). Each phase built logically on the previous one.",
        "You demonstrated excellent recovery skills when you misunderstood the guest's point about 'misreading' - instead of getting defensive, you opened it up with 'Oh, we can go both. How did Gen Z misread that?' This flexibility kept the conversation flowing.",
        "Your question density was optimal at roughly one question per 2-3 minutes of guest response time, allowing for substantial exploration without losing momentum. The guest never seemed rushed or cut off."

      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "When you said \"I absolutely agree\" and then immediately challenged with \"But you said something interesting\" - this pattern of validation-then-probe appeared 3 times and consistently led to the guest's most nuanced responses.",
        "Your admission \"I'm not an expert at podcasting\" near the end was strategically brilliant, creating space for the guest to offer additional insights while demonstrating intellectual humility that strengthened rather than weakened your authority.",
        "The moment you said \"to put myself on the spot\" before sharing how the guest changed your mind about social media showed exceptional intellectual honesty that transformed you from interviewer to co-explorer of ideas."

      "unlockedHtml": "Your energy started analytical and became increasingly personal. Early questions were more formal (\"Why do you think adults constantly and consistently dismiss...\") while later ones were conversational (\"So again putting you on the spot just for a second\"). This shift toward intimacy unlocked deeper responses.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [

        "You showed increasing comfort with silence and space - early responses were immediately followed by new questions, while later you allowed natural pauses that let ideas breathe and develop organically.",
        "Your stance-shifting became more pronounced as the conversation progressed, moving from Gen Z advocate \u2192 devil's advocate \u2192 genuine seeker. This evolution kept the guest engaged and prevented predictable responses."

      "unlockedHtml": "You and Dr. Z co-created a reframing of generational conflict as communication opportunity. Your questions about 'misreading' sensitivity led to her 'fragility is fluency' insight, while your challenge about cancel culture evolved into her 'conscious culture' framework. These weren't just interviews - they were collaborative meaning-making.",

Your longest question was 89 words (about economic crisis and entitlement), while your shortest was 8 words (\"Do you think that they would be even open to being told that they are incorrect?\"). This range shows good instinctive pacing.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your talk-to-listen ratio was approximately 15:85, which is excellent for deep exploration. However, your questions averaged 31 words each - consider that your most powerful questions were under 20 words ('Why are you doing this?' generated the most authentic response).",
        "You used 'I' statements in 34% of your questions, showing good personal investment without overshadowing. Your self-disclosure moments (therapy insight, book writing experience) comprised only 8% of your total speaking time - optimal for maintaining focus on the guest.",
        "Your interruption rate was near zero, but you had 6 instances of compound questions that could have been split for clearer focus. Your strongest responses came from single-focus questions rather than multi-part inquiries."

Your therapy reference and book-writing experience added depth, but developing conscious criteria for self-disclosure will help you maintain the balance between personal investment and guest focus that you achieved naturally here."
