So again, on the pre call... we talked about before, like people asking for BDSM tutorials, being able to chat with somebody...\\\", you covered 3-4 different angles. Try isolating one concept per question to get deeper, more focused answers that serve your audience better."

Your transition at \\\"I think this is the point in the conversation where we're going to be a little bit fluid\\\" marked a clear shift from information-gathering to challenge mode.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your conversation had three distinct phases: Discovery (first 6 exchanges), Challenge (middle 8 exchanges), and Integration (final 4 exchanges). You spent 60% of the interview in challenge mode, which created excellent tension but may have limited deeper exploration of solutions.",
        "You used 4 major pivots to redirect the conversation, with your strongest being the grandmother example that helped you grasp the concept viscerally. This personal connection point shifted your questioning style from skeptical to genuinely curious.",
        "Your pacing accelerated noticeably in the middle section, with shorter, more rapid-fire questions. This created energy but sometimes didn't allow full development of complex ideas before moving to the next challenge."

Because when you pay for that service, you expect a level of professionalism.\\\" This moment showed you processing and accepting a new perspective in real-time.",
      "lockedParagraphsHtml": [
        "Your most powerful question was \\\"What is stopping this from becoming more mainstream?\\\" because it shifted from theoretical discussion to practical barriers. This question demonstrated sophisticated thinking about implementation challenges rather than just concept criticism.",
        "The Uber analogy question showed your ability to think systemically about potential problems: \\\"How do we stop this Uber problem?\\\" This revealed your understanding of how good ideas can be corrupted by poor execution or misaligned incentives.",
        "Your final personal question \\\"Who are you? What are your morals and ethics?\\\" was perfectly timed after establishing the business case, allowing your audience to understand the human motivation behind controversial work."
